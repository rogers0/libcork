Package: libcork-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Suggests: libcork-doc
Depends: libcork16 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: simple, easily embeddable, cross-platform C library (development files)
 It falls roughly into the same category as glib or APR in the C world;
 the STL, POCO, or QtCore in the C++ world; or the standard libraries of any
 decent dynamic language.
 .
 So if libcork has all of these comparables, why a new library? Well, none of
 the C++ options are really applicable here. And none of the C options work,
 because one of the main goals is to have the library be highly modular,
 and useful in resource-constrained systems. You’ll hopefully see how this
 fits into an interesting niche of its own.
 .
 This package provides C header files for the libraries.
